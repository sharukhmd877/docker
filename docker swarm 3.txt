created 3 ec2 vm
in user data (in advance setting when you are configuring ec2)
    #!/bin/bash
	sudo su
	yum install docker -y
	service docker start
rename vm - manager, worker 1, worker 2
login to ec2 instance
in manager vm - docker swarm init --advertise-addr <private_ip>c (it will generate a token, copy it)
in worker 1 and worker 2 - paste the token
in manager vm - docker node ls
				docker service create  --name nginx-service nginx
				docker service ls
				docker service ps nginx-service
				docker rm nginx-service
				
				docker service create --name nginx-service --replicas 3 nginx
				docker service ls
				docker service ps nginx-service
				docker service inspect nginx-service
				docker service inspect nginx-service --pretty
				
	instead of 3 service i want 5 
				docker service update --replicas 5 nginx-service
				docker servicce ps nginx-service
				
				
in worker 1 and worker 2 - docker ps


# what if any container is down
in worker 1 - docker stop CONTAINER id
			  docker rm container id
			  
still the container is running 
manager - docker service ps nginx-service


#what if whole node is down (worker 1 is down)
worker1 - service docker stop

manager - docker service ps nginx-service
( services has been recreated in the remaining nodes)


#docker swarm network mesh

manager - docker service rm nginx-service
		- docker service  create --name nginx-service -p 80:80 --replicas 2 nginx
		-docker service ps nginx-service (to get the list of created service)
		
worker 1 and worker 2 - docker ps
